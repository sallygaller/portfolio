			<h2 class="p-top-15 f-size-22">Hello!</h2>
					<p>I'm a software developer currently living in Portland, OR. I have a background in music, sound design, and database administration, all of which have laid the foundation for an exciting career in software engineering.</p>

			<h2 class="f-size-22">About Me</h2>
      <div class="group-reverse">
        <div class="item-double">
          <p>I've played and composed music almost all my life, and I've found that music lends itself to software development in lots of ways. Learning music and learning to code are like speaking new languages, and uilizing that language to write a composition is similar to building an application that an end user would enjoy. I love how being on a team of great software developers is like being in an orchestra: we're creating and building something together, and we each have our part to play.</p>
          <p>The overarching theme of my academic and professional background is problem-solving. I've realized that I find joy in problem-solving, whether it's finding the perfect chord progression or fixing a bug. I feel really lucky that web development allows me to collaborate with others, be creative, and be a full-time problem-solver.</p>  
          <p>I'm a junior full-stack developer specializing in website design and web applications. I love creating clean, simple designs that are beautiful, too. I'm also passionate about developing technology for wildlife and environmental conservation.</p>
          <p>I'm originally from Somerset, a county in south-west England known for cheddar cheese and excellent accents. In my free time I enjoy <a class="main" href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77742961-sally-galler" target="_blank">reading</a>, playing video games, <a class="main" href="https://soundcloud.com/sallysounds" target="_blank">recording birdsong</a>, and trying desperately not to kill the plants in my garden.</p>
